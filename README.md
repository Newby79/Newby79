- 👋 Hi, I’m @Newby79, i live in the Netherlands so please excuse my poor english.
- 👀 I’m interested in how github works, learning how to write codes in/with github and have no idea how or where to start... I am not an expert on computers, so sometimes i will ask stupid questions to verrifie what you ment.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about how to make a simple digital clock with an esp8266, a ds3231 and a max7219 module (4x8x8). Bought myself these components, a breadboard, some jst wires and am eager to learn how to make all of this work together.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on this and learn how to write codes and/or how to use codes that already exist on this platform.
- 📫 How to reach me: i have no idea on how this platfor works, so my geuss is that i will recieve an email orso if you respond to this intro of mine.
